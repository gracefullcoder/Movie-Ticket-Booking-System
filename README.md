This C++ code implements a movie ticket booking system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Here's a brief overview of its functionality:

1. **Classes**:
   - The code defines several classes: `Timings`, `Movie`, `Theater`, `City`, `Customer`, and `admindetails`.
   - Each class represents a specific entity in the movie ticket booking system, such as movie details, theater details, city details, customer information, and admin details.

2. **Features**:
   - Admin can log in using their credentials and perform various operations.
   - Admin can add other admins, theaters, movies, and customers.
   - Admin can also edit their details or the details of customers.
   - Customers can register with their name and email.
   - Customers can book tickets for movies at different theaters in various cities.
   - The system maintains booking details, including customer information, movie details, timing, and total amount.
   - The system tracks box office collections for each theater in a city.
   - Booking details are written to a file (`booking_details.txt`) for record-keeping.

3. **Data Management**:
   - The code manages data using vectors to store objects of various classes such as cities, theaters, movies, customers, and admin details.
   - It also handles file I/O operations for writing booking details.

4. **User Interface**:
   - The code provides a console-based interface for admins to perform operations.
   - Admins are prompted with menu options to choose from various actions like adding theaters, movies, customers, booking tickets, etc.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Error handling is included for cases such as invalid inputs, incorrect choices, and customer not found scenarios.

6. **Modularity**:
   - The code is divided into functions and classes, ensuring modularity and ease of maintenance.

7. **Documentation**:
   - The code includes comments to explain the purpose of each class, function, and major code blocks.
   - Documentation helps in understanding the code's logic and functionality.

This movie ticket booking system demonstrates the practical application of OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism in building a real-world software system.
